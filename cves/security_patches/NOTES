In order to run the notebook, the following things are needed:

- file called `secrets` with a single entry representing Git Hub API token
- models parts need to be concatenated together using `cat models.tar.bz2.* > models.tar.bz2`
- cvedb cloned from https://github.com/fabric8-analytics/cvedb locally
